When it appears to the left, it looks like this: 衤, and we shall take it to mean cloak. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, giving us: , which we shall take to mean a scarf. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitives: , in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of garment in general.

      "As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of rice, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for wheat that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes the shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.",

      "As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form 亻. The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of person so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.",
